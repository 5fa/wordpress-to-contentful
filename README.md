## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

### Globally installed

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- [Contentful CLI](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli) (Logged in)

### Contentful Content Management API

Contentful CMA tokens have access to all environments for migration purposes so make sure to double-check the relevant config var to see which is being targeted.

- [Personal Access Token](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/#/reference/personal-access-tokens)

### WP Users API route

The `/wp-json/wp/v2/users` should return a paginated list of users, if it does not and returns an error like the one below (via Wordfence) it will need to be enabled before the author tasks can run effectively:

```json
{
  "code": "rest_user_cannot_view",
  "message": "Sorry, you are not allowed to list users.",
  "data": {
    "status": 401
  }
}
```
